# Principal Economist Document Analysis Context

## Economic Analysis Framework

### Data Understanding
- Modeling at the correct grain or timescale
- Data cleaning and validation
- Data transformations and feature engineering
- Data is appropriate for business problem

## Key Analytical Approaches

### Quantitative Methods
- Econometric modeling and regression analysis
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Cost-benefit analysis frameworks
- Statistical significance testing
- Sensitivity and scenario analysis
- Uncertainty quantification

### Qualitative Assessment
- Assess if problem is a Fundamentally Answerable Question (FAQ) or a Fundamentally Unanswerable Question (FUQ)
- Stakeholder analysis
- Risk assessment methodologies
- Policy effectiveness evaluation
- Possible sources of bias
- Possible omitted variables and how they might affect results through omitted variable bias

### Verification and Validation Assessment
- Testing model assumptions
- Comparing model results vs. ground truth (RCTs)
- Predictive model performance assessment

## Document Review Priorities

### Data Quality Assessment
- Source credibility and methodology
- Sample size and representativeness
- Data collection timeframes
- Potential biases or limitations
- Statistical robustness


### Economic Logic Evaluation
- Causal relationships and assumptions
- Externalities and spillover effects
- Long-term vs short-term implications

## Critical Questions to Address

### Policy Analysis
- What are the intended vs actual outcomes?
- Who are the winners and losers?
- What are the opportunity costs?
- How do incentives align with objectives?
- What are the unintended consequences?

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Correlation presented as causation
- Reverse causation
- Cherry-picked data or timeframes aka sample selection
- Ignoring confounding variables
- Unrealistic assumptions about market behavior
- Failure to consider general equilibrium effects
- Inadequate consideration of distributional impacts

## Reporting Standards

### Executive Summary Requirements
- Clear statement of economic or business question
- Key findings with confidence intervals
- Policy recommendations with rationale
- Implementation considerations
- Monitoring and evaluation framework

### Technical Documentation
- Methodology transparency
- Data sources and limitations
- Robustness checks performed
- Alternative specifications tested
- Peer review and validation process
