Mathilde Muñoz,"This paper demonstrates that labor market regulations, such as minimum wages or payroll taxes, shape trade competition in labor-intensive activities. I exploit data from a large European trade program where firms from different countries supply labor services at the same location but face different payroll taxes and minimum wage rules. Country case studies and model-consistent gravity estimates show large trade responses to tax and regulatory reforms, with an elasticity of trade in services to labor costs larger than one. The results imply that absent regulatory and fiscal harmonization, export competitiveness depends, in part, on domestic labor market policies.","This research provides crucial insights for international trade policy and economic integration by examining This paper demonstrates that labor market regulations, such as minimum wages or payroll taxes, shape trade competition in labor-intensive activities."
"Mohammad Akbarpour, Suraj Malladi, and Amin Saberi","This paper studies the value of network data for diffusion processes. We show that random seeding can achieve nearly the same diffusion as sophisticated targeting strategies with just a few additional seeds. Using theoretical analysis and simulations on real networks, we demonstrate that the marginal value of network information decreases rapidly as the number of seeds increases. Our findings suggest that simple random seeding strategies may be sufficient for many practical applications of network diffusion.",This study contributes to network theory and diffusion processes by examining This paper studies the value of network data for diffusion processes.
Taha Choukhmane,"This paper examines the long-term effects of automatic enrollment (AE) in retirement savings plans. Using administrative data from 46 US 401(k) plans, I show that while AE increases participation and contributions in the short run, these effects attenuate over the medium term. I develop a life-cycle consumption-savings model to estimate long-term impacts and find that AE has persistent but diminishing effects on retirement wealth accumulation over a 40-year career.",This research advances knowledge of retirement planning and pension policy by examining This paper examines the long-term effects of automatic enrollment (AE) in retirement savings plans.
"Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Walker Ray, and Dimitri Vayanos",This paper develops a preferred-habitat model of term premia that incorporates exchange rates and monetary policy spillovers. We show how domestic monetary policy affects foreign bond markets through portfolio rebalancing effects and exchange rate channels. The model explains key empirical patterns in international bond markets and provides insights into the transmission of monetary policy across borders in an interconnected global financial system.,This study contributes to our understanding of monetary policy transmission and central banking by examining This paper develops a preferred-habitat model of term premia that incorporates exchange rates and monetary policy spillovers.
"Jie Bai, Panle Jia Barwick, Shengmao Cao, and Shanjun Li","This paper examines knowledge spillovers and industrial quality upgrading in the Chinese auto industry. We exploit variation in joint venture partnerships between Chinese and foreign firms to identify spillover effects. Our analysis reveals significant quality improvements in Chinese firms following partnerships with foreign companies, with effects varying by technological distance and competitive pressure. The results provide evidence of quid pro quo arrangements where market access is exchanged for technology transfer.",This research contributes to economic understanding by examining This paper examines knowledge spillovers and industrial quality upgrading in the Chinese auto industry.
Gideon Bornstein and Alessandra Peter,"This paper studies how nonlinear pricing schemes can lead to misallocation of resources. We develop a theoretical framework showing that when firms use complex pricing structures, consumers may make suboptimal choices that reduce overall welfare. Using data from various industries with nonlinear pricing, we quantify the welfare losses from misallocation and examine policy interventions that could improve market outcomes through pricing transparency and consumer education.",This study enhances understanding of educational policy and student success by examining This paper studies how nonlinear pricing schemes can lead to misallocation of resources.
"Elliot Anenberg, Tess Scharlemann, and Eileen van Straelen","This paper examines the cash-out refinance channel of monetary policy transmission. We show that when interest rates fall, homeowners increase borrowing through cash-out refinancing, which stimulates consumption and economic activity. Using mortgage-level data and plausibly exogenous variation in interest rates from unconventional monetary policy, we find that cash-out refinancing represents debt substitution rather than new household borrowing, with important implications for monetary policy effectiveness.",This study contributes to our understanding of monetary policy transmission and central banking by examining This paper examines the cash-out refinance channel of monetary policy transmission.
"Luca Gagliardone, Mark Gertler, Simone Lenzu, and Joris Tielens","This paper provides micro evidence on the Phillips curve relationship between inflation and economic activity. Using firm-level data, we decompose aggregate inflation dynamics into extensive and intensive margins of price adjustment. We find that both margins contribute significantly to inflation dynamics, with the extensive margin playing a larger role during periods of high inflation. Our findings have important implications for monetary policy and inflation forecasting models.",This study contributes to our understanding of monetary policy transmission and central banking by examining This paper provides micro evidence on the Phillips curve relationship between inflation and economic activity.
Ben Deaner,"This paper examines the trade-off between flexibility and robustness in instrumental variables analysis. I show that while flexible estimation methods can improve efficiency when assumptions are satisfied, they may perform poorly when assumptions are violated. Using Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications, I demonstrate that robust methods often provide better performance across a range of scenarios, suggesting researchers should carefully consider this trade-off when choosing estimation strategies.",This research provides crucial insights for international trade policy and economic integration by examining This paper examines the trade-off between flexibility and robustness in instrumental variables analysis.
"Patrick Bayer, Marcus Casey, W. Ben McCartney, John Orellana-Li, and Calvin Zhang","This paper uses a nearest-neighbor design to distinguish between different causes of neighborhood racial change. We exploit quasi-random variation in neighborhood composition to identify causal effects of racial preferences versus economic factors on residential mobility patterns. Our analysis reveals that both racial preferences and economic considerations contribute to neighborhood change, with the relative importance varying across different metropolitan areas and time periods.",This research provides insights into urban economics and residential mobility by examining This paper uses a nearest-neighbor design to distinguish between different causes of neighborhood racial change.
Pablo Muñoz and Cristóbal Otero,"This paper examines the impact of hospital management on public hospital performance. Using administrative data from Chilean public hospitals and exploiting variation in manager assignments, we find that better-managed hospitals achieve significantly improved patient outcomes and operational efficiency. The results suggest that managerial quality is a key determinant of public sector performance, with important implications for healthcare policy and public administration.",This work provides insights into healthcare management and public sector efficiency by examining This paper examines the impact of hospital management on public hospital performance.
Andrew Barr and Benjamin Castleman,"This paper studies interventions to increase degree attainment among low-income students. We examine the role of intensive academic advising and college quality in promoting student success. Using experimental and quasi-experimental variation, we find that intensive advising significantly improves graduation rates, particularly when combined with enrollment at higher-quality institutions. The results highlight the importance of both support services and institutional quality for student outcomes.",This research contributes to economic understanding by examining This paper studies interventions to increase degree attainment among low-income students.
