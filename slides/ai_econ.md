## The AI-Powered Economist

Economists risk obsolescence if we don't update our workflow to use Gen AI:

*   Convergence of job families into a "Super IC"
*   Increased impact and expanded frontier of possibilities
*   Reduced dependencies on other specialists (e.g., engineers, IT, etc.)
*   Must embrace short term pain to integrate AI into our workflow


##  Agenda

Today, I will show you a couple ways AI is changing how Economists work:

*   Everyday tasks with documents
*   Using Quick Suite for research and automation
*   Building code with Q CLI
*   Building code with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)


##  AI Workflow Demos

*   Everyday tasks
    -   Working with documents (summary, assessment, writing)
    -   Eliminating toil (convert whiteboard images to markdown)
    -   Assessing submissions for a poster session
*   Doing research with Quick Suite
*   Building code to answer research questions using *prompt driven development*

*   [Kiro](https://docs.hub.amazon.dev/kiro/user-guide/getting-started/) is a similar option: IDE with AI code generation capabilities


##   Warning: Ownership and Quality

You remain the owner of all work you create with Gen AI:

*   Trust but verify
*   Don't cowboy push some vibe coded AI slop to prod....
*   You are still responsible for quality and ethical standards of your work
*   Don't outsource your thinking to AI, use it to accelerate your workflow
*   Fact-check every fact at the original source
