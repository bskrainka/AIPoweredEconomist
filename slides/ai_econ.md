##  Economics and Generative AI

This is a big topic and could mean:

*   How AI affects society and the economy
*   Using AI to increase productivity, scope, and scale
*   Using deep learning techniques in Economic models

I will focus on using AI tools to super-charge the workflow for Economics


## The AI-Powered Economist

Economists risk obsolescence if we don't update our workflow to use Gen AI:

*   Convergence of job families into a "Super IC"
*   Increased impact and expanded frontier of possibilities
*   Reduced dependencies on other specialists (e.g., engineers, IT, etc.)
*   Must embrace short term pain to integrate AI into our workflow


##  Agenda

Today, I will demo a couple ways AI is changing how Economists work:

*   Everyday tasks using [Q CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-installing.html):
    -   Working with documents (summary, assessment, writing)
    -   Eliminating toil (convert whiteboard images to markdown)
    -   Assessing submissions for a poster session
*   Performing research and automation using [Quick Suite](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/)
*   Building code to answer research questions using *prompt driven development* 
    using [Q CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-installing.html) or [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)


##   Warning: Ownership and Quality

You remain the owner of all work you create with Gen AI:

*   Trust but verify
*   Don't cowboy push some vibe coded AI slop to prod....
*   You are still responsible for quality and ethical standards of your work
*   Don't outsource your thinking to AI, use it to accelerate your workflow
*   Fact-check every fact at the original source
